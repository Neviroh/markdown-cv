Main skills:

* Ability and strive to learn: I often find, learn and propose new technologies and patterns to a team
* Initiative, genuine care about the product, its success and convenience for customers

## Work History

**iiko**, Kazan, Russia / 2020 - Present

Currently at [iiko](https://iikosoftware.com), developing a powerful loyalty system for restaurants of any kind to keep and expand customer count using marketing campaigns, discounts, bonuses programs, notifications etc.

* As part of the process of migrating monolithic system to a microservice architecture, I built new .Net Core microservices that improved the stability of system events reports and part of the public API 
* Integrated automated OpenAPI documentation generation with NSwag to our process, which made debugging and testing of APIs a lot easier and faster
* Integrated Redis to our tech stack, solving the problem of effective caching for Docker-based microservices
* Mentored new developers, helping them familiarize themselves with our project and become a stable part of the team
* Suggested adjustments to our Agile process by adding a specific period for task decomposition and system design discussions, which were approved and made our plans more reliable
* Improved monitoring for our notification system, which allowed us to identify the reason for a crucial problem that bothered our clients for a long time, and fix it 
* Significantly improved stability and readability of code for notifications, system events logging, and server-client synchronization, which fixed some major bugs and allowed the team to spend much less time on debugging problems with them later

My tasks also often include fixing customer issues by interacting with the customer support team, designing APIs, refactoring legacy code, and developing new features that are requested by customers.

**KOMIS**, Kazan, Russia / 2018 - 2020

I was mainly engaged in the development of desktop software for accounting visitors, monitoring and managing security systems of an office building, using WPF, PostgreSQL, and Entity Framework.

* Starting as a junior developer in a small one-man Unity project, successfully completed it and then transferred to another project during the start of the development
* Was the one who initiated the code review practice, and convinced the team of its usefulness, which resulted in a much more error-proof process of developing and shipping the software to the client
* Updated codebase by introducing Entity Framework and Dapper instead of the internal ORM, which significantly increased developing speed for all SQL-related tasks
* After some time took the place of a team leader and was able to bring the product to the state of full functionality, allowing the client to use it in a production environment
