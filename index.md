Specialized in backend development of .Net core services, planning and evaluatin of services architecture and API, maintaining services stability, locating and fixing of existing problems through communtations with the support team, and expanding software's functionality.

My strengths are involvement in the process, initiative, ability to mentor, ability communicate with different teams inside the company, interest in the success of the product and its convenience for customers, as well as the desire to grow as a specialist and the ability to learn, including from one's own mistakes. I highly value simplicity and extensibility of the code, always focus on the SOLID principles where it's possible and appropriate. 

My current main stack of technologies is .Net Core/Framework, NHibernate/Entity Framework, MS SQL Server/PostreSQL, NUnit, Redis, Javascript and also Prometheus, Grafana and ElasticSearch for monitoring and support. I've mostly worked with backend, but I'm ready and willing to learn new technologies as well, including expanding my experties in frontend side of development.

## Work History

**iiko**, Kazan, Russia / 2020 - Present

Being part of the team that's responsible for maintaining and expanding the loyalty/marketing services of the ecosystem of iiko, among other things I've achived the following:
* Improved stability of part of the legacy code
* Created and finished two of the new .Net Core services that are now part of the ecosystem
* Provided an API for different team that needed new ways to access some of our existing functionality
* mentored two new employees that are now stable part of the team
* finished experimental Xamarin project for mobile platform, 
* offered an improvement in the process of code review and tasks planning for a development cycles
* Introduced to the team solution for an automatic API documentation generation

My current day-to-day tasks are:
* Evaluation, planning and development of new functionality to cover new demanded customer needs
* Search and analyze customer issues by interacting with the customer support team
* Stabilization and optimization of legacy solutions and services, code refactoring to support its extensibility
* Separating some of the functionality from the legacy monolithic service into new .net core services deployed in Docker, thus ensuring greater stability and scalability of the ecosystem as a whole
* Research and integration of new technologies for the team when there is a need for them
* Mentoring new team members when they join the team, getting them to know the project, its specifics and approaches adopted by the team 

The process of completing tasks often includes:
* Interaction with other teams responsible for individual services of the iiko ecosystem, including thinking through the interaction of services with each other

**KOMIS**, Kazan, Russia / 2018 - 2020

I was mainly engaged in the development of desktop software for accounting visitors, monitoring and managing security systems of an office building, using WPF, PostreSQL and Entity Framework.

Starting as a junior developer in a small one-man Unity project, I've sucessfully completed it, transferred to a bigger team developing desktop software, became the initiator of the introduction of code review practice, and ended up as team leader, managing small team of three other developers. So naturally, aside from technological skills, I gained experience in task and developers managing, mentoring, improved planning and task decomposition skills.
