# Vladislav Lipatov
.Net Developer

## Currently

At [iiko](https://iikosoftware.com), developing powerfull loyalty system for restaurants of any kind to keep and expand customers count using marketing campaigns, discounts, bonuses programs, notifications etc.

Specialized in backend development of .Net core services.

In my opinion, my main strengths are: 
* initiative, genuine care about the product, its development, success, and convenience for customers
* readability and extensibility of my code, ability to follow SOLID principles while keeping code simple and effective
* experience as a team leader, which gave me a lot of lessons on the process of managing developer teams and communicating with colleagues and customers
* ability to analyze, break down and complete big tasks while keeping it manageable and verifiable; 
* ability to detect the need for new technology, to find, learn it, and then implement it as a new part of the workflow

My current main stack of technologies is .Net Core/Framework, NHibernate/Entity Framework, MS SQL Server/PostreSQL, NUnit, Redis, Javascript and also Prometheus, Grafana, and ElasticSearch for monitoring and support. I've mostly worked with backend, but I'm willing to learn new technologies as well, including expanding my expertise in frontend side of development.

## Work History

**iiko**, Kazan, Russia / 2020 - Present

Being part of the team that's responsible for maintaining and expanding the loyalty/marketing services of the ecosystem of iiko, among other things I've achieved the following:
* built new .Net Core microservices using technologies that were new to the team at the time: Entity Framework, Redis, automated OpenAPI documentation generation with NSwag
* mentored new employees that are now a stable part of the team
* improved our process of code review and task planning for development cycles
* developed an experimental mobile-platform project using Xamarin
* significantly improved stability and readability of many portions of a legacy codebase: notifications, system events logging, revision-based server-client synchronization of data, and other

My tasks also often include fixing customer issues by interacting with the customer support team, designing APIs, refactoring legacy code, and developing new features that are requested by customers. 

**KOMIS**, Kazan, Russia / 2018 - 2020

I was mainly engaged in the development of desktop software for accounting visitors, monitoring and managing security systems of an office building, using WPF, PostgreSQL, and Entity Framework.

Starting as a junior developer in a small one-man Unity project, I've successfully completed it, transferred to a bigger team developing desktop software, became the initiator of the introduction of code review practice, introduced the team to Entity Framework and Dapper, and ended up as team leader, managing a small team of three other developers. So naturally, aside from technological skills, I gained experience in task and developer managing, mentoring, and improved planning and task decomposition skills.
